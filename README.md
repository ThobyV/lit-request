##lit-request

Lit request is a small, byte-sized micro-library which provides the most important parts of Axios which alot of developers love using the ``browser native fetch``  under the hood. Lit is for developers who prefer all things small and ligh-weight.

Heavily inspired by Redaxios but with more focus on request/response interceptors.

Can I use Just Axios? Yes you can if you prefer to because it is battle-tested and supports node js and more features than lit-request as well. Lit is mostly advantaged being small and simple in cases where bundle size matters, it could be used for quick projects and other kinds of projects as well.
